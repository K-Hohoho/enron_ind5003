# enron_ind5003
The Enron Email corpus consists of emails from 150 users, mostly senior management. It was made public during an investigation into the Enron scandal. Your task is to carry out an unsupervised learning analysis of the Enron corpus.


* 2 Submission Delieverables *
The following are the submissions for the group project:
1. Video presentation
• A 10-minute video to be uploaded to a sharepoint folder (to be created closer to the submission
date). The presentation should communicate the major findings from your data analysis. The
portion on methods review can be kept to a minimum.
• You can assume that the audience for the presentation is a technical audience, i.e. it is a
knowledge-sharing presentation.
2. Report
• A data analysis report submitted as a pdf document.
• The maximum number of pages should be 20, excluding cover, contents, references and ap-
pendices. The font size cannot be smaller than 10 Times New Roman.
3. Source codes
• A zip file containing all the Python source codes written for the project.
• Codes can be in the form of python notebooks, or in the form of scripts/modules, or a
combination of both.
The deadline for all the submissions is 4th Nov 2359hrs.

* 3 Grading (50%) *
The total marks for the project is 50% of your final grade. This is broken down into 40% for a common
group grade, and 10% for an individual grade.
3.1 Group grade (Total: 40%)
Video presentation (Subtotal: 10%)
The video presentation will be graded on clarity of content and creativity.
Data analysis report (Subtotal: 20%)
You are encouraged to include the following sections in your report (other sections are up to your
discretion):
1. Methods review. This section could be a review of relevant/existing work similar to the task, or
it could be a quick introduction to the model used in the report (if it is not one that was covered
in the lecture notes).
2. Statement of questions of interest. These are the 2 - 3 research questions that you aim to answer
with this analysis.
3. Data overview. This section is where you can describe the data collection and preparation proce-
dures. Credit will be given for finding relevant datasets that provide additional evidence/context
for your conclusions.
4. Overview of code structure.
The data analysis report will be graded on the quality of the analysis and the clarity of the report. In
terms of clarity of report, we look for the use of proper English (no bullet points). We also encourage
the use of visualisations. The report should be well-organised.
In terms of quality of analysis, we look for iteration in the analysis, since every analysis reveals a bit
more about the data, and suggests what could be done next. The findings pertaining to the questions

of interest should be communicated clearly, demonstrating understanding of techniques. A discussion
of the limitations of the analysis should also be present. Evidence of self-learning, where you identify a
new technique, or go deeper into one of the techniques introduced in the lectures) also counts as a plus
point.
A very insightful paper by prominent statisticians (McGowan, Peng, and Hicks (2023)), breaks down
every data analysis into six areas that can be used to assess its quality. These six areas are: data quality,
exhaustiveness, skepticism, second-order questions, clarity and reproducibilty of analysis. You may want
to skim through the paper when assessing the quality of your own report.
Please note that NUS has a policy on the use of AI for homework. I encourage you to use AI models
to assist with writing code, but do ensure that you do not violate the university guidelines. Especially
when writing reports, bear in mind that these models do tend to invent references, authors and titles.
Code (Subtotal: 10%)
Code is assessed in terms of reproducibility, documentation (via comments/docstrings/README files),
and organisation of folders.
3.2 Individual grade (10%)
The individual component will kick in after the submissions. The score comes from:
1. Your rating by fellow group members.
2. Individualised quiz questions on your own project. This quiz will be conducted in the week 13
lecture time. It may include asking about the source codes that your group submitted.
